## Welcome

This site contains materials for learning data visualization in R using `ggplot2` and other tools. It was assembled for the SPARC data visualization seminar (2025).

## Contents

### [Presentation: Data Visualization](presentation.html)
#### *The substance, statistics, and design behind good, honest graphics*

- Edward Tufte's principles of graphical excellence
- Tooling and workflow (R, ggplot2, scientific notebooks)
- The grammar of graphics
- Selected topics

## Data

The repository contains two main data directories:

- `data/raw/`: Contains the original, unmodified data files used in the course
- `data/processed/`: Contains processed and cleaned versions of the data, ready for analysis

### PRAMS Data

The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data used in the examples on Day 2 is not included in the repository due to its large size (150MB+). However, you can download it directly from the CDC's data portal:

[CDC PRAMStat Data for 2011](https://data.cdc.gov/Maternal-Child-Health/CDC-PRAMStat-Data-for-2011/ese6-rqpq/about_data)

This dataset contains state-level maternal health data from 2011, including information about maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy. It is used in the a
