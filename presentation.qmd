## Achieving Minard's Graphical Excellence

> "[Minard's classic image] can be described and admired, but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonder graphic in a million.""

*Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 1983*

## For The Rest of Us

Instead, Tufte suggests:

::: {.incremental}
* "[For] more routine, workaday designs"
* "[Have] a properly chosen format and design"
* "Use words, numbers, and drawing together"
* "[D]isplay an accessible complexity of detail"
* "Avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk"

# AI, LLMs, and Data Visualization

## AI and Data Visualization

* AI and LLMs are becoming more and more powerful
* They can help you with many data-related tasks, but require care

## My Philosophy

* I use LLMs in nearly all aspects of my work
* I have found that there is now less value in being able to "make computer do something" and more in high level concepts
* To that extent, when discussing data visualization, I now focus a little more on concepts and less on `ggplot2` syntax, since LLMs really can mostly solve technical visualization problems with a few minutes of "conversation"


## Proof of Concept

* Let's take the mtcars dataset and see what we can do

```
I have a plot of auto data. The data set is named "auto." The variables I'm interested are: price, efficiency (variable name: mpg), weight, and manufacturer.  The data set only includes the variable "make," which has both the manufacturer and the car name.  Can you first split "make" into "manufacturer" and "model." Weight is a continuous measure, but it would be helpful to split this data into categories of small, medium, and large.

I'd then like a plot comparing efficiency to weight. Facet this into small, medium, and large cars. On each figure, annotate the least efficient car with its make and model, one average car with its make and model, and the most efficient car with its make and model.

Put the code for this in a new quarto notebook named llm-example.qmd
```


# The Grammar of Graphics

## `ggplot2` and the Grammar of Graphics

* The "gg" in ggplot2 stands for the grammar of graphics, a concept coined by Leland Wilkinson and popularized by Hadley Wickham.
* Grammar in language is a set of rules for how language is structured.
* Grammar in graphics is a set of rules for how visual representations of data are structured.

## Key Concepts in ggplot2

![ggplot2 workflow](images/gg-flow.png)


## `ggplot2` Workflow

::: {.incremental}
1. Start with data
2. Pick an aesthetic mapping
3. Choose a geometric object
4. Add statistical transformations
5. Adjust finer details: scales, coordinate systems, faceting, etc.
:::

## Aesthetic Mappings


* This is how your variables map onto the aesthetics of your figure
* It sounds highfalutin, but it usually just means:
    - What is your x?
    - What is your y?

## Geometric Objects ("geoms")

* Geoms are the elements used to represent the data
* Geoms have associated stats/functions/statistical transformations
* Stats such as counts for groups often involve aggregations

## Geoms (cont.)

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em;"}

| Geom | R Function | Stat/Transformation | Use for |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Point | `geom_point()` | Identity | Scatter plots |
| Bar | `geom_bar()` | Count | Bar plots |
| AB Line | `geom_abline()` | Slope | Line plots |
| Horizontal line | `geom_hline()` | Y intercept | Reference lines |
| Vertical line | `geom_vline()` | X intercept | Reference lines |
| Smoother | `geom_smooth()` | Smoothing function (GAM, Loess, etc.) | Showing patterns/trends |

:::

## Position/Fill


* You can use position/fill to move elements around and color code geoms by aspects of the data, such as categories.
* For example, with a bar chart:

  - `stack`: Stack bars on top of each other
  - `fill`: Stack bars, but make them always fill up vertical space to 1
  - `dodge`: Put the bars next to each other

* Tip: When you reach for fill, always consider faceting in small multiples. The brain struggles with fills. More on this later.

## Aggregations

* To make a bar chart, one groups data and takes a mean, proportion, or count
* Software like ggplot will try to do this for you and it works well for simple cases
* This can fail with more difficult aggregations or when doing things like applying annotation labels
* A powerful and frustration-reducing technique is to do the aggregation yourself and then use the `identity` mapping
* This separates the statistical logic from the visual logic and is often what makes a tricky figure easier to make


## Purposes of Visualization: Exploration

- Goal: Understand the data structure, data generating mechanism, relationships among variables, etc.
- Start here
- Don't polish; these are for you
- Still consider good practices: you don't want to misunderstand things because of scale, position, poor color separation, etc.

## Purposes of Visualization: Sharing Results

- Goal: share your findings
- Get the data and message right
- Make things look nice
- Consider text annotation
- Still don't go too crazy, especially when the target is a journal that will redo your figures

## Some Topics

I've prepared a web site at the [JHBC GitHub](https://jhbiostatcenter.github.io/sparc-data-viz).

We can choose our own adventure. The order is somewhat sensible.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring data to understand it
* **Colors &amp; Theming**: Accessibilty for the vision impaired, reusable design systems
* **Causal Inference & DAGs**: Generating DAGs easily to help think about causal structures for causal inference
* **Selected Topics**: A handful of important topics such as use of position and scales, choosing good visualizations, applications
* **Refine &amp; Polish**: Using `R` and `ggplot2` to build up and refine visualizations
* **Shiny**: Interactive dashboards
